Account: The current player entity
Account Strikes: The HP of our player
Disassembly Cannon/Transmission Protocol: The "gun" of the player. It shoots requests. Security is eliminated by requests as they receive credentials that
show you are a trustworthy user. When you are hit by the enemies "requests" they are able to determine your identity and you gain an account strike

Proposed Game Mechanic: Sever exploits
	Basically screen clear bombs, picked up from enemies/destructibles (You discover weak points in the system which can be targeted)
	
	Idea to test: After using, the screen colors get inverted temporarily. During this time, you can destroy enemies/somehow restore your health
			After that short period of time, the immediate room/nearby world reboots

	When using the bomb, the area around you gets scrambled (this is due to you resetting the local cluster)

Keygens: Stations you can use to gain more admin passwords. Requires the player to shoot at them for a continuous period of time
(ie, the credentials need to be generated and sent over)

Ports: Spawn points. These are basically bases that the player can "capture" to gain a spawn point. Ports allow the player to
get a new account and restore account strikes.

Firewalls: Refers to when entryways are closed off and the player is stuck in a room. Basically refers to indestructible barriers
Security system: The enemies of the game.
