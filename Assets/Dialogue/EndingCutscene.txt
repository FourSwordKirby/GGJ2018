Circe: <Surprised> Wait, there's nothing here??

Kali: <Serious> Hold on Circe, I'm picking up something

Kali: <Surprised> THE CREDITS?

[Resume Gameplay]

Circe: <UpsetWorried> Wait, what do you mean its the credits?

Circe: <UpsetWorried> We definitely targeted the right server..

Kali: <Disappointed> Unfortunately, it looks like this was just a prototype project

Circe: <Disappointed> It took them a whole year to make this...

Circe: Talk about a let down

Kali: <Neutral> Well, Rome wasn't built in a day Circe

Circe: Is this really on the scale of Rome...

Kali: <Disappointed> To be honest, no

Kali: <Neutral> But... It wasn't a total waste!

Kali: <Excited> I'm sure the next cache we hit will have some juicy secrets at the end!

Circe: <Pleased> I guess you're right Kali. Not every lead can be a game-winner after all

Circe: <Neutral> See you tomorrow then?

Kali: Yep, tomorrow!
