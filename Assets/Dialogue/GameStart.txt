[>l Circe]: Circe: Ugh, headache. 

Kali: This is Kali connecting in. Hacker C.R.C., are you in?

Circe: Hah... formal as always aren't you, Kali? As a childhood friend, I'm deeply hurt when you address me like that-

[>r Kali]: Kali: N-no! That is just a standard procedure! A-anyways, did you make in alright... Circe?

Circe: No problems here. Just a slight headache. Probably because my damn boss has been making me work overtime on a useless feature for our website.

Kali: (worried) Oh... You can take a rest for today Circe! If it will endanger the mission-

Circe: Shut it. I've been waiting all day for this hack.
	You said this was a big job didn't you? I can't wait to beat digital hell into some security programs.

Kali: O-oh... Don't push yourself, okay?
	But yes, we have been hired this time to perform a high-risk infiltration to extract sensitive data.
	I logged you on as the super user account for a machine in one of the target's server clusters.
	
Circe: Man, even though we have the tech to link our brain signals into a computer, how come my virtual avatar is still so... blocky?

Kali: I-It was the best I could do! I've told you a bunch of times I know I don't how to model cute things-
	AHEM! I have outfitted you with a Datagram Transport Cannon.
	For now, let us try moving to another server cluster. Repeatedly shoot the port to the north to upload yourself to the next server cluster.
