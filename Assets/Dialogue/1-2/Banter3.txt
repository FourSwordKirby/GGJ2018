Kali: <Pleased> Yup! I managed to resell it at 5 times the retail price.

Circe: <Agitated> Hey! I got you that for your birthday so you could play it!

Kali: <Smug> Well, now I can buy 5 times the number of game consoles!

Kali: <Excited> And it is in the form of hard cash, so I had flexibility in where I spent it!

Circe: <Disappointed> Hah... that's not what you're supposed to do with presents...
