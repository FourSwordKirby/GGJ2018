Kali: The designers of this system must be some hardcore retro game otaku huh

Circe: Speaking of games, did you ever end up using those retro games system I gave you on your birthday?

Kali: (looking pleased) Yup! I managed to resell it at 5 times the retail price.

Circe: Hey! I got you that so you could play it!

Kali: And it is in the form of hard cash, so I had flexibility in where I spent it!

Circe: Hah... that's not what you're supposed to do with presents...
