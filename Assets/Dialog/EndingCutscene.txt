Circe: We definitely targeted the right server..

Kali: Unfortunately, it looks like this was just a prototype project

Kali: Well, Rome wasn't built in a day Kali

Circe: Is this really on the scale of Rome...

Kali: To be honest, no

Kali: But... It wasn't a total waste!

Kali: I'm sure the next cache we hit will have some juicy secrets at the end!

Circe: I guess you're right Kali. Not every lead can be a game-winner after all

Circe: See you tomorrow then?

Kali: Yep, tomorrow!
