Kali: I know its been a bit since your last hack, so I'll be guiding you through the basics as we get through this login portal

Circe: Kali please, I don't need any handholding

Kali: Oh... But I already started the tutorial module.

[Tutorial starts] 

Circe: Don't sweat it, I'll just let the prompts play themselves on the screen.

[Resume Gameplay]

Circe: While that happens, let me vent for a bit

Circe: You know that project that my team has been working on?

Kali: You mean the digital assistant that responds to voice on the front page of our website

Kali: That sounded really interesting!

Circe: It does, until you realize that clicking one of the nearby hyperlinks is faster than trying to talk to a bot

Circe: Anyways, the some idiot decided it was time to upgrade the voice recognition library

Circe: And of course, I was the one stuck tracking all of the compatibility errors that popped up in the aftermath

Circe: The upgrade doesn't even add any features that we'd use! It's all superflous things like social media integration

Kali: Shouldn't you be having this discussion with the rest of your team?

Circe: Dammit Kali... you know me in real life, I can't actually do that.
