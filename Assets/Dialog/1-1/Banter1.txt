Kali: I know its been a bit since your last hack, so I'll go over the basics

Circe: Kali please, I don't need any handholding

Kali: Oh... But I already started the tutorial module

[Tutorial starts] 

Circe: Don't sweat it, I'll just let the prompts play themselves on the screen.

[Resume Gameplay]

Circe: While that happens, let me vent for a bit

Circe: You know that project that my team has been working on?

Kali: You mean website's digital assistant?

Kali: That sounded really interesting!

Circe: It does

Circe: Then you realize that talking to a bot is too much effort

Circe: Anyways, the some idiot decided to upgrade the voice recognition library

Circe: And of course, I was the one stuck fixing all of the compatibility errors

Circe: We don't even use anything from the upgrade!

Circe: It's all junk like social media features

Kali: Shouldn't you be having this discussion with the rest of your team?

Circe: Dammit Kali... you know me in real life, I can't actually do that
